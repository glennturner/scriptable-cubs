# CUBS Home Game Scriptable Widget

A no-frills Apple Scriptable widget that displays whether there's a Chicago Cubs home baseball game today.

If there's a home game, it displays:

- The team they're playing
- The time the game starts or ... 
- The state of the game: pre-game, game inning, ended
- If the game has ended, green denotes that the Cubs won. Red denotes that they lost

## Installation

It's a [Scriptable](https://scriptable.app/) app script, so just install [Scriptable](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/scriptable/id1405459188?uo=4) and copy/paste `cubs.js`.

## Who asked for this?! Why not use the MLB app or isthereacubsgametoday.com?!

I asked myself for it, as I routinely travel down near Wrigley Field! 

Both the MLB app and isthereacubsgametoday.com either fail to provide the game context, or I was too impatient to dig for it. Also? Faster to glance at a widget. Lastly? I can view the widget on any Apple device. 

(Additionally, [isthereacubsgametoday.com](isthereacubsgametoday.com) is no longer updating, although it was when I created this widget.)

I've been using it for a number years -- pre-and-post lockdown and, while it's simple, it's served me well.

## Who cares about the game's context?

Have you ever been around Wrigley Field after a win? Especially on a Friday or Saturday? It's a madhouse and I try to avoid the area if possible.

## Could I use this with another team?

I only need to know if there's a Cubs home game but, yeah, sure. Just alter the team ID. You can find your team ID by going to the `Downloadble Schedule` and check for the team_id in the `Download Home Season Schedule` link.
